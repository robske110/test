## Setup

### Setup for beginners

A quick heads-up beforehand: Setting this up for someone who has never setup a webserver before can be challenging.
Don't worry though, the beginners guide tries to help you as much as possible and guides you through every step.
The guide for beginners is currently being written. Please check back later!

### Setup for advanced users.

Prerequisites are: 
- PHP 8 cli
- A webserver serving .php files (PHP 8)
- (strongly recommended) HTTPS enabled server with certificate
- A postgresql server (Any version from 9 and up should work, although testing has only been done on 11 and up)

Clone this project.

`cloneurl`

Create a database (and a user) in your postgresql server for this project and fill in the details into config/config.example.json and .env.example. We'll need these files later.
You can alternatively use the config setup wizard by running the setup-config.sh script.
Note: for a detailed description of the possible config values visit [config.md](docs/config.md).

After creating the config.json from config.example.json run start.sh.
After a successful connection the the db the setup wizard will help you create an API key for the widget and a user for the website.

All files in the `public directory of this repository must now be placed somewhere in the webroot.
It is recommended to place them in the second level (not directly in webroot).

Then copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` outside the webroot and edit the options within it.

`env.php` looks for a `.env file two folders up from its location.
(If you put the contents of the public folder in `/path/to/webroot/vwid/` it will look in `/path/to/.env`)
If you place the files deeper inside the webroot, please consider editing env.php and configuring the correct path in the first line. It is strongly recommended keeping the .env file out of the webroot.

You can alternatively set the environment variables through your webserver. (Or anything else that populates php's `$_ENV`)

After successful start you can now visit idView.php or use the iOS widget after [setting it up](docs/iosWidget.md)!
